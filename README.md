# 🌱 TerraScope — Field Intelligence for Farmers

**TerraScope** is a satellite-driven field intelligence platform designed to help farmers understand the health of their fields *before* problems become visible to the naked eye.

By combining **remote sensing**, **geospatial analysis**, and a **farmer-friendly interface**, TerraScope transforms complex satellite data into clear, practical insights about crops, soil moisture, and potential field risks.

Instead of overwhelming users with raw indices or technical jargon, TerraScope follows a **progressive explanation approach** — guiding farmers from overall field condition to crop health, water & soil influence, and possible risks.
